# fitpts

Over the summer I learned flask and built something for my mom  Every week, my mother and her friends report their physical activities to each other and are awarded points for their hard work, pushing themselves to exercise by fostering competition.  My mom would record these points using pencil and paper.  Fitness Points is a simple application I made that simply logs and keeps track of these points while providing a weekly and overall leaderboard. I made this mostly to teach myself the Flask framework, to develop my web development skills, and to help my mom out a bit. 

Utilizes the Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and SQLAlchemy-migrate extensions.
